// Background message handler for Firebase Cloud Messaging
// NOTE: Background handler is now registered in services/notification.service.ts
// to avoid duplicate notifications. This file is kept for reference but handler
// registration is handled by NotificationService.initialize()

// Background handler registration has been moved to NotificationService.initialize()
// to prevent duplicate notifications. The handler is registered with a flag check
// to ensure it's only registered once.
